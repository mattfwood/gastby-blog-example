My name's Matt Wood, I'm a self-taught, full-stack developer from Dallas, Texas. I specialize in front-end engineering, specifically with React and creating Javascript tools. I've also written a fair amount of Python for Raspberry Pi projects.

I spend my free time starting more projects than I'll ever be able to finish and convincing myself that they'll make things easier.
